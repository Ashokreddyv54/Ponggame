My game structure:

1. we need to create score board class.

2.we need to create body for two bats and also we need to give them motion.

3.we need to create a turtle ball that will move across the screen and it has to start randomly, and whenever to touches the bat and edges of the screen it need to bounce.

4.when ever we miss the turtle score point have to increase opposite side and again new game starts.
